# **One Frame, Many Stories: Predicting Football Match Events from Single Images**

This repository contains the final project for the course "Computer Vision & Image Processing" of Bocconi MSc in AI. This project was done by Beatrice Citterio, 
Clara Montemurro and Martina Serandrei. 

In order to use the contents of this repository, you need to first download the data at [this link](https://sites.google.com/view/image-and-video-analysis): 
you need to download all seven parts and then use the command <code>7z x data5.rar</code> to unzip the files. After this, in order to have the same structure we have, 
you need to run the first cell of the <code>data_loading.ipynb</code> notebook, which will put all images in one folder, <code>data/images</code> and discard 
duplicates.
